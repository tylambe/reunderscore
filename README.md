# Overview

<a href="http://underscorejs.org/">Underscore.js</a> is an expansive JavaScript library that abstracts dozens of incredibly useful processes into easy-to-use functions. By nature, these functions are stored as methods in an object saved as the _ property on the global window object.

While being able to use underscore will make you a stronger programmer, knowing how each of these functions is working will enhance your understanding not just of functions, but also the objects, Booleans, and other datatypes you use already. This `reunderscore.js` is a practice library complete with a testing suite to help you hone your chops.

## Installation

Almost none! Here are two different ways to get started:

#### Git

Go to your command line and enter `git clone https://github.com/tylambe/reunderscore`

#### Download as a .zip file

Scroll up on this page to the green 'Clone or download' button, click 'Download as Zip', and find the folder titled 'reunderscore' wherever your browser usually downloads files. Unzip and you will have access to the project folder. Drag the entire folder into the code editor of your choice (Sublime, Atom, VSCode, etc.).

## Usage

```
reunderscore
  |-lib                 # Contains testing libraries and SpecRunner styling
  |-spec
    |---part1.js        # Tests for Part 1
    |---part2.js        # Tests for Part 2
  |-src
    |---reunderscore.js # Complete the functions in this file to make the tests pass.
  |-SpecRunner.html     # Open this file in your browser to check your progress.
```
As you complete the functionality for each function in `reunderscore.js`, refresh the SpecRunner.html file in your browser to see if your functions pass each test. If you are failing a test, consider the assertion provided by a specific test and write the proper functionality.
